Sorry, but this is everything but super!  
Quick sketch put together during a presentation/workshop with the [Graffiti Research Lab Germany](http://www.graffitiresearchlab.de) team.  
The idea was to go on a bike rider after the workshop, when the sun was down, with the amazing [Lightrider](http://www.graffitiresearchlab.de/light-rider/).One of my first experiments with code. A simple 2D particle system with physics and Kinect interaction.  
Done with [Processing](http://www.processing.org "See more of Processing ->"), with the [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/) library.
