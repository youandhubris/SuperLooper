Sorry, but this is everything but super! ( :  

Quick sketch put together for a presentation/workshop with the [Graffiti Research Lab Germany](http://www.graffitiresearchlab.de) team, during the *Resposive Spaces* program at the [School of MA](http://schoolofma.org).  
The idea was to go on a bike rider after the workshop, when the sun was down, with the amazing [Lightrider](http://www.graffitiresearchlab.de/light-rider/), and do a urban intervention. Either with project, sound or both. So I said... Sound!  

It's a really simple sketch, but people had so much fun I decided to share and, if I have time, to some upgrades. [Soma Holiday](http://somaholiday.com) is joining in!
Done with [Processing](http://www.processing.org "See more of Processing ->"), with the [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/) library.
